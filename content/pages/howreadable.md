title: How Readable?
---

Thank you to everyone who took part in the first phase of this experiment investigating **readable code**

I have processed the **results** and presented my initial findings on **Dec 6th 2018** at the [Async meetup in Brighton](https://asyncjs.com/readable-code/). You can watch my talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlczTNFHpww) and the slides are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlczTNFHpww).

More details about the experiment are available [here](/readability).

The next phase of research will start in autumn 2019

If anyone has any queries or comments, or would like to get involved in the ongoing experiment, please email info@howreadable.com
