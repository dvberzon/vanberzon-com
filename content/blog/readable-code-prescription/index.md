Between you and I, I have never been very good at grammar. I grew up burdened by terrible spelling, atrocious handwriting and a patchy understanding of grammar rules. At school, my heartfelt compositions were met with disdain from grumpy English teachers, who returned them to me covered in red ink. They used to strongly disapprove of my split infinitives and any sentence that a preposition found itself at the end of.

It’s partly why I grew up to be a developer. The reason and logic in the practice of programming were comforting compared to the unfair and arbitrary grammar and spelling rules that I could never remember. But with the passage of time, my hatred of grammar has turned into a fascination.

At [Ocasta](https://ocasta.com), we have incorporated tools into our workflow for automated code linting. Linter software will parse your source code and evaluate it against a set of published guidelines for coding style. If the program feels that parts of your code are breaking these style rules, it will helpfully underline them in red.

Whenever it does this to my code, I find myself uncomfortably reminded of my school work defaced with red ink. It recently occurred to me that this is not just a visual coincidence. I believe that both the grumpy English teachers and the automated linting algorithms are falling into the same trap. That of blindly following prescriptive rules.

What are prescriptive rules? How can we avoid them? And are there better alternatives to help us improve our code?

## Description vs Prescription

Ever since I read “[The language instinct](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Language-Instinct-Creates-Penguin-Science-ebook/dp/B002RI9DJW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1547309336&sr=8-1&keywords=the+language+instinct)” by Stephen Pinker, I have been fascinated by the difference between prescriptive and descriptive grammar. The grammar rules taught in school and policed by copy editors are prescriptive rules. These are rules that prescribe the way that people should speak, and people who don’t follow them are judged to be using the language incorrectly. Here are some examples you may have come across.
